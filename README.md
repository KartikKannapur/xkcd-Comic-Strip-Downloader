About xkcd
===========================

xkcd, sometimes stylized as XKCD, is a webcomic created by Randall Munroe. The comic's tagline describes it as "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language." Munroe mentions on the comic's website that the name of the comic is not an acronym but "just a word with no phonetic pronunciation".

xkcd is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License. New comics are added three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,although on some occasions they have been updated every weekday.
